**Scripts for Sandbox API calls**

Two sample scripts to call Sandbox API functions.
One is to asset files, one for URL analysis.

**Careful**
If a file is hosted and available for download directly from the URL, the submission will be a file type submission (script "submitfile.sh") which can be deleted.

**Scripts for Sandboxing Archives using Powershell**
The powershell cript uses PSFalcon (see https://github.com/CrowdStrike/psfalcon and https://github.com/CrowdStrike/psfalcon/wiki)
